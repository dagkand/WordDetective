# WordDetective: Substring Edition

WordDetective: Substring Edition is intended to be both a resource for learning and a brainteaser for those wishing to challenge their vocabulary.

The main objective of the game is to write words containing the substring given by the game. For example: If you play the category "Fruits" and the substring is _PL_ a correct solution can be Ap<span style="color:green">pl</span>e.

The application comes with default categories, but you can also create your own custom categories.
